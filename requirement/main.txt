I. Main idea
People don't know what they don;t know. It will be great if we can show them what they don't know based on what they already know.
- Provide mind map tool for people to organize their knowledge
- Auto send "next thing to know" to user from what they already read => daily learning courses
- Knowledge can be collected from other resources such as websites, blogs, video , etc
- Each knowledge must be categorized and labelized and put in relationship with the other, to build a mindmap.
Contributor have main role in constructing this mind map.
- Allow scoping. Knowledge can be configured to be shared in groups or people
- Allow user to submit their concern and notify professional one to contribute
- Each knowledge usually have many resources, we let reader rating them.
- Engage user by show them their knowledge coverage and regularly test them or remind them ?
- Engage user to summarize knowledge ?
